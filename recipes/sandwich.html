        <h3 class="step one">Step one: Choose bread</h3>
            <p>For the first step, be sure to choose a bread that will suit the sandwich you are trying to make.
                Some selections are pretzle bread, wheat bread, white bread, and my personal favorite, sour dough.
            </p>
        <h3 class="step two">Step two: Choose meat</h3>
        <p>The meat you choose can make or break your sandwich, so choose wisely.
            If you want a cold sandwich, I suggest turkey, if you want a warm sandwich, I'd say ham, both are great choices,
             but feel free to choose whatever you'd like as long as it's logical.
        </p>
        <h3 class="step three">Step three: Combine</h3>
        <p>Whether you're eating it cold or heating it up, you must combine your meat and bread,
             it's simple, just make sure to not leave too mush hanging off the sides.</p>
